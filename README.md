# 🚀 **ElectricPe – Lead-to-Delivery Funnel Optimization**

## 📌 **Overview**
This project was completed as part of the **Business Analyst Internship Assignment** for **ElectricPe**, a leading EV mobility platform.  
The objective was to analyze the **end-to-end customer journey** from **Lead → Pre-booking → Booking → Delivery** and identify operational bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and actionable insights to improve **conversion rate, delivery turnaround time (TAT), and customer satisfaction**.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Map the complete **lead-to-delivery funnel** and calculate **conversion rates** at each stage.  
- Analyze **store-wise and lead-type performance** to identify high-performing segments.  
- Measure **TAT** (Pre-booking, Booking, Delivery) to locate process delays.  
- Examine **cancellation trends**, **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**, and **customer complaints** to assess satisfaction.  
- Provide **data-backed recommendations** to improve **conversion, reduce cancellations,** and **enhance delivery efficiency**.

---

## 📊 **Dataset Summary**
- **Total Leads:** 1000  
- **Pre-bookings:** 812 (**81% conversion**)  
- **Stores Analyzed:** Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai  
- **Lead Types:** Hot (30%), Warm (51%), Cold (19%)  
- **Metrics:** Conversion %, TAT (days), Cancellations (%), NPS, Complaints

## 🧩 **Key Insights**

| **Area** | **Insight** | **Impact** |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Conversion Funnel** | 81% of leads converted to pre-booking; consistent store performance (~23–24%) | Strong top-of-funnel handling |
| **Lead Segmentation** | Cold leads (19%) had zero conversion → missed engagement opportunity | Target automation to cold leads |
| **TAT (Turnaround Time)** | Average 10.5 days total; delivery stage contributed ~45% of total time | 1-day potential reduction |
| **Cancellations** | Avg 27%; major reasons: price (30%), financing (16–27%) | Introduce EMI/flexible payment options |
| **Customer Satisfaction (NPS)** | NPS ranged from -36 to -23; weak post-sales follow-up | Opportunity for recovery programs |

## ⚙️ **Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
   - Processed lead, booking, and delivery data in Excel using formulas and pivot tables.  
   - Defined logic for **high-potential leads** (Hot/Warm, non-cancelled, low TAT, high rating).  

2. **Funnel & Performance Analysis:**  
   - Calculated **store-level and lead-type conversion rates**.  
   - Analyzed **TAT across stages** to identify slow-performing stores.  
   - Visualized trends in **complaints, cancellations, and ratings**.  

3. **Dashboarding:**  
   - Built an **interactive Excel dashboard** with conversion funnel, TAT performance, NPS, and cancellations.  
   - Enabled easy **store-level comparison** and actionable visualization for management.  

4. **Insight Storytelling:**  
   - Compiled findings into a concise **data → insights → actions → impact** format for business presentation.
